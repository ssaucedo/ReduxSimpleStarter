To create a controlled Component we need
to set our state whenever the input is changed
When we refer to state in the Component we refer
to Component state not redux level state. Two completely
separated things.


We use <form> instead of <div> for "form" components
because it provides some built in functionality that saves
us to define custom eventHandlers for the "enter key" and for the
submit button click event. We just handle onSubmit and don't care
about the different ways the form can be submitted. (cons: we need to preventDefault)
