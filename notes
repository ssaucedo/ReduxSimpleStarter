To create a controlled Component we need
to set our state whenever the input is changed
When we refer to state in the Component we refer
to Component state not redux level state. Two completely
separated things.


We use <form> instead of <div> for "form" components
because it provides some built in functionality that saves
us to define custom eventHandlers for the "enter key" and for the
submit button click event. We just handle onSubmit and don't care
about the different ways the form can be submitted. (cons: we need to preventDefault)



Middleware:

Our functions that take an action and depending on the action type or payload
or other factors, it can let the action pass through, manipulate it, console log it,
or any other action before they reach any reducer.
Kind of gatekeeper. Stop any actions, inspect it and then decide how to manipulate it.


We can have many different steps of middleware in our application.
